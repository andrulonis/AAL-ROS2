R{"energy"}=? [C<=num_predictions*2]
//R{"energy"}<power_budget-(59.275 * 5*(obstacles-obs_detected))[C<=num_predictions*2] //budget minus expected energy needed for remaining mission
//R{"pictures"}=? [C<=num_predictions*2]

// idea: We want 5 pictures per obstacle. Each adaptation should insentivise resulting in 5 good pictures while maintaining enough battery for the remaining mission
